# Aiko's Inflection (Unstable Pre-release/work in progress)

A plugin for Dalamud to modify speech input and output based on rules that you set for yourself.
This plugin is primarily intended for use _as a toy_ and can be used for RP, immersion or other.
**Disclaimer**: This is just a proof of concept that I made to see if I could. It's intended to be a toy, nothing more. Please treat it like that.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to my darling Aiko for inspiring me to make this project, probably never would have even tried otherwise. <3

## Features

- Supports (Out of Character) and \*Custom Emote\* as per standard RP practice.
- Profiles (Including several builtin presets)
  - Builtin presets for soft voice, BIG VOICE, bimbo voice, catgirl nyaaa, muted voice, and nervous voice
  - TODO: Import/Export to be able to share profiles with your other friends
- Text commands for automation and integration with puppetmaster,  character select+, etc.
- Speech alterations configurable with the following:
  - S-s-stuttering
  - Word restrictions (delete words that are disallowed)
  - Word substitution
  - small voice setting so that you can yell in lower case...!
  - BIG TALK MODE FOR SERIOUS BIG VOICE PERSONS!!!!
  - Randomized Vocal Ticks (For adding a little bit of random flavour to boring sentences).
  - Sentence start/end "ticks"

## Stability (i.e. There is none)

TL;DR: This is currently a **very early work in progress** (consider it an in **development alpha build**).
Until v1.0 your configurations and profiles can and will be deleted if incompatible with the changes. (I'm sorry, I'd love to write a migration each time, but it's too much work for something that is prerelease)

Versioning follows [semantic versioning](www.semver.org) with the addition of the "build" which will typically be 0, except on testing branches where

### Testing branch

As per dalamud, the testing versions are there for in progress features. Testing is intended for myself and helpers that want to provide feedback on the next version.
