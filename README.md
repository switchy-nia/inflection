# Aiko's Inflection [Work In Progress]

A plugin for Dalamud to modify speech input and output based on rules that you set for yourself.
This plugin is primarily intended for use _as a toy_ and can be used for RP, immersion or other.

**Disclaimer**: This is just a proof of concept that I made to see if I could.
It's intended to be a toy, nothing more. Please treat it like that.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to my darling Aiko for inspiring me to make this project, probably never would have even tried otherwise. <3

## Features

- Supports (Out of Character) and \*Custom Emote\* as per standard RP practice.
- Profiles (Including several builtin presets)
  - Builtin presets for soft voice, BIG VOICE, bimbo voice (for the girls at the boudiore), catgirl nyaaa, muted voice, and nervous voice
  - TODO: Import/Export to be able to share profiles with your other friends
- Text commands for automation and integration with puppetmaster,  character select+, etc.
- Speech alterations configurable with the following:
  - S-s-stuttering
  - Word restrictions (No no terms)
  - Pronoun substitution/Correction
  - small voice setting so that you can yell in lower case...!
  - BIG TALK MODE FOR SERIOUS BIG VOICE PERSONS!!!!
  - Randomized Vocal Ticks (For adding a little bit of random flavour to boring sentences).
  - Sentence start/end Ticks (What's the proper linguistic term, anyone know?)
